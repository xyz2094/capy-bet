### CapyBet web-dev project

A responsive web application developed as the final project for the 
Basic Web Development class. It simulates a betting website and 
incorporates key web development technologies and practices learned 
throughout the semester.

The project ensures optimal viewing experience across various devices
and screen sizes, provides intuitive navigation throughout the website, 
allows users to register and log in with credentials stored using the 
`localStorage` API, and Simulates a betting system where users can place 
bets and view outcomes.

How to run:
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/vittordallacqua/capy-bet.git
> cd capy-bet
> open src/index.html
```
